5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Almost heaven,    West Virginia 

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah  River   

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Life is old there,   older than the trees    

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Younger than the mountains,   growing like a breeze  

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Country roads,       take me home      

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 To the place         I   belong     

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
West Virginia, mountain mama

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Take   me home,     country  roads         

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All my memories   gather 'round her    

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Miner's  lady,   stranger  to blue water   

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dark  and  dusty,   painted on the sky

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye  

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Country roads,       take me home      

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 To the place         I   belong     

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
West Virginia, mountain mama

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Take   me home,     country  roads         

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me  

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The radio reminds me of my home far away   

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Driving down the road, I get a feeling

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,500
That I should have been home   yesterday,        yesterday        

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Country roads,       take me home      

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To the place         I   belong     

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
West Virginia, mountain mama

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,000
 Take   me home,          country  roads         

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Country roads,   take me home
