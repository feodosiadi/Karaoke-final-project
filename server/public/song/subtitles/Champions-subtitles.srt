1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I've paid my dues     

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Time  after time      

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,500
I've done my sentence      

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
But committed no  crime     

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
 And bad mistakes    

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
   I've made   a few       

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,500
  I've had my share   of sand kicked   in my face 

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
 But I've come through

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,000
And we mean to go on  and on  and on   and on...    

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We  are the champions,  my friends    

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,500
And we'll keep on fighting till the end      

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,000
We are the champions 

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
We are the champions 

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
No time for losers

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
'Cause we are the champions    of the world
